# NotesApp_ReactNative
A simple note taking app with a Strapi backend.
Strapi is a headless CMS framework that allows you to integrate CMS functionalities into any of your technical stacks. This gives you more flexibility when choosing the different components that make up your project.
For the time being I have used Strapi as a backend, but if the app goes live, I will use Amazon s3, or Firebase with the use of custom api's.
